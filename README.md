A collection of useful utilities for administering GemFire


## gemtouch

The "gemtouch" tool can be used to facilitate recovery over WAN

This utility connects to the JMX manager to determine the list of all regions in a distributed
system.  It then creates a normal client connection via locators and runs the "Touch" function
on all regions.  The "Touch" function gets and then puts every entry in the region.  This causes 
each region to forwarded all entries over any running senders that they are connected to.

If an entry happens to be updated or removed between the time that this utility performs a get and
the time that it attempts a put, the put will be aborted to avoid accidentally undoing an update 
from an external source.  In other words, the utility is safe to run on an active cluster.

## checkred

The "checkred" tool can report regions that are "at risk" because they are not fully redundant. 
The tool only reports on the redundancy status of partitioned regions.  Replicate regions are 
redundant so long as more than one member of the distributed system is running.

## trace / untrace

you must deploy the gemtools jar using the "gfsh deploy" command,
then ...

to install tracing on a region

```
trace.py locatorhost[port] /SomeRegion
```

to remove tracing on a region

```
untrace.py locatorhost[port] /SomeRegion
```


# Installation 

Unpack the tarball: gemtools-VERSION-runtime.tar.gz

This will create a directory, "gemtools" which contains everything needed to run the script (except a JVM)

There is a server side component to this utility, use gfsh to deploy gemtools/lib/gemtools-VERSION.jar to 
the cluster that you want to act upon.

Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to a java installation. 
The script will execute the JVM at $JAVA_HOME/bin/java


# gemtouch usage

gemtouch.py --jmx-manager-host=abc --jmx-manager-port=123 --jmx-username=fred --jmx-password=pass --rate-per-thread=100

* --jmx-manager-host and --jmx-manager-port are requires and must point to a GemFire jmx manager (usually the locator).
If you are not sure of the port number try 1099
* --jmxusername and --jmx-manager-password are optional but if either is present then both must be
* --rate-per-second is optional - acts a a throttle if present

#### note on compatibility with the dynamic region management project

* if the metadata region (__regionAttributesMetadata by default) is  present it will be touched first
* the name of the metadata region can be set with the --metadata-region-name option
* after touching the metadata region the program will pause for 20s to allow for
propagation the length of the wait (in seconds)  can be set using the --region-creation-delay option



# checkred usage


checkred.py --jmx-manager-host=abc --jmx-manager-port=123 --jmx-username=fred --jmx-password=pass 
	--jmx-manager-host and --jmx-manager-port must point to a GemFire jmx manager (usually the locator)
	--jmxusername and --jmx-manager-password are optional but if either is present the other must also be provided

* checkred will return with a 0 exit code if all partition regions have redundancy
* checkred will return with a 1 exit code if any partition regions do not have redundancy

##### additional options
By default, checkredundancy will report only partition regions that do not have redundancy
* --verbose will cause checkredundancy to report redundancy of all regions
* --wait=20 will cause checkredundancy to wait up to 20s for redundancy to be established
